I have had 3 prior surgeries and none have been as effective as the 4th under Dr. Thacker! She really goes over the Cat Scan and identifies ALL areas the require correction. And then follows through in the operating room. I highly  recommend her to anyone considering sinus correction surgery. Thanks so much Dr. Thacker for greatly enhancing my quality of life!', ""I went to Dr Thacker after having blockage and congestion in my sinuses for over 6 months. I did the CT scan she recommended and looked at it in her office with her. She pointed out where my sinuses were blocked and that I had a deviated septum. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the worst she said I was a 9 with blockage. I had polyps and one especially blocking 99% of my left nostril. I had the choice of sinus surgery at the hospital under general anesthesia with multiple Dr's involved or do the surgery in-office. Dr Thacker said it would be like going to the dentist with in-office surgery.  I don't go under with anesthesia unless i have no choice. Dr Thacker did an amazing job clearing my sinuses and fixing my deviated septum. There was little discomfort and the next day no pain. I have never been so pampered and taken care of as I was before and after surgery by Dr Thacker and the entire staff. I will never forget that!"", 'I first went to Dr. Thacker for what I had been told would be sinus surgery. She believed my condition was autoimmune related and surgery would not fix my problem. She was 100% correct and thanks to her ability to look at the entire person (and not just one anatomy part of that individual) I was given a new lease on life! My condition is improving and I am on the road to complete recovery without sinus surgery. ', 'After years of constant sinus infections. Hundreds of doctors visits with several different doctors and being left feeling like I was crazy. I was finally referred to Dr. Thacker. Dr. Thacker listened to me and took the time to help me figure out what was going on. After 6+ years of pain Dr. Thacker figured out that I had a primary immune disease. She is an amazing doctor! ', 'Dr. Thacker is an amazing doctor who helped me out with a diagnoses, and intervention after so many years of suffering from sinus and ear infections. If it wasn’t for Dr.Thacker I would of never found a way to deal with my reoccurring infections. I can’t thank Dr.Thacker enough for all of her help. ', 'Dr. Thacker is tops in her field!  She is very thorough.  Well worth the trip to Worcester!', ' I just had the procedure a balloon sign you sinosply). Dr. Thacker it was excellent.

I had a balloon sinulplasty procedure done by her and she explained the procedure thoroughly before implementation. The office checks up on me after visitation to ensure that I am feeling better and that no other concerns have arisen. Dr. Thacker noticeably keeps current with research in topics related to otolaryngology and provides alternative medicinal options as well as traditional ones.', 'Dr. Thacker is an amazing Doctor.  Very knowledgeable, helpful and kind! This team made an uncomfortable procedure go so smoothly, and as comfortable as possible.  I would highly recommend this Dr. and staff.\n', 'I absolutely recommend Dr. Ito on every single count. \n\n1. Fantastic surgeon!\n2. Very friendly/Easy to talk to.\n3. Kept me informed about everything with my current and possible future care. \n4. Showed he cared about my full recovery by adding a follow-up when full recovery wasn\'t evident at normal final follow up. \n\nI have been a mouth-breather forever. I simply couldn\'t breathe out of my nose well. Nothing helped and as time passed my breathing slowly went from difficult to ""feels like I\'m trying to breathe through a straw at a Boba Tea shop"". Plus, I could never smell well and this too was getting worse. \nAfter seeing Dr. Ito, he set me up for a septoplasty/sinuplasty very quickly. The surgery was my first major surgery under anesthesia and my first major surgical recovery. \nIt was no big deal. Healing was quick and clean. The second Dr. Ito removed my stents, I could breathe! \n\nHe honestly changed my life. There has been such a benefit. \nIf you need an ENT doctor/surgeon go to him!', ""I had NO sense of smell for almost 7 years! Most people don't realize that your sense smell is over 80% of what you taste. I love to cook and it was incredibly depressing not to be able to taste what I made. I had another surgeon perform 3, very painful, sinus surgeries prior to meeting Dr. Ito.  After I was referred to Dr. Ito, he formulated a treatment plan and performed surgery that was an immediate success! My sense of smell was restored when I left day surgery, that was almost a year ago. I have been able to smell (without being on Prednisone) for an entire year. The treatment plan that I follow, keeps the disease at bay. I would shout his name off of rooftops if that would help others who are plagued with loss of smell, it is a huge loss and sadly most people fluff it off.  Dr. Ito is a wonderful, skilled, caring doctor and he listens to his patients."", ""My Sinus infection started from about 3 years ago, those 3 years was a literal hell, I had complete loss of smell and loss of taste, I couldn't ever taste the food I was eating. Everyday I would wake up with massive fatigues, I'm not exaggerating a single bit when I say the fatigue and feeling like crap was far worse than a hungover; and that was everyday. My eyes were burning ALL the time like if I had onions next to them 24/7. I had a lot of sinus pressure and nasal congestion which was always stuffed with mucus disabling my ability to breathe thru my nose. I had every sympton at it's most severe state.\n All that messed up with me emotionally, I started to get depressed, it affected my quality of life completely. Then I had surgery with Dr Ito and it was like a miracle, I was completely better after surgery everything had gone away, I can finally breathe correctly, and I've gotten my life back. He is the absolute best doctor ever!!"", 'He is excellent ', 'I have had serious sinus problems and I have seen a few sinus doctors. They told me there was nothing they could do for me because my previous doctor performed surgery on my sinus and removed too much tissue. My family Doctor gave me antibiotic for one week, but it did not help me. I saw Dr. Ito and he helped me a lot. My sinus is getting much better now. I would like to say thank you to him, you really helped my sinus problem!\n\n']","['Very knowledgeable diagnose clearly explained; follows thru.\nMore than worth the waiting time', 'Excellent skills and knowledge. \nHave always been ver satisfied with appointments and his ability to explain issues.

I had a hole in my face at least the size of a quarter for a week, while waiting to hear whether or not all of the cancer had been removed.  Dr. Checcone's staff was very polite, efficient, and attentive.  Dr. Checcone evaluated the opening during a consult and then performed the surgery the next day.  He is a talented plastic surgeon who did an outstanding job.  He took a round hole and turned it into a longer scar which he moved closer to my jaw line so that it would appear more natural.  It has healed very well and people who have seen the before and after can't believe it.  He even managed to save my beard by ensuring the scar didn't interfere too much with the natural hair growth!  Highly recommend."", ""Four years ago I had a failed skin graft from a dermatologist after MOHs surgery on my nose - my nostril collapsed when breathing in. Dr Checcone reconstructed the nose using a piece of bone from the nasal septum as structural support and remaking the nostril- scary with great outcome.  I sought his expertise again for another basal cell on the other side of my nose- he made the incision so you  can't see the repair after a few months."", 'I wish for the readers hereof to take a moment while I tell the good news regarding Dr. Checcone and his staff.  Each member of the staff is welcoming and competent.  When I placed my initial call, the voice at the other end enabled me to sense that the office would take good care of me.  Because my left ear was almost completely blocked, my need for an appointment was urgent.  April offered me a convenient appointment.  \n\nFrom the moment I entered the waiting room, I was greeted cheerfully.  April and Flo assisted me as needed in the completion of the new-patient forms.  The waiting room is spacious, comfortable and attractive.  \n\nUpon my first meeting with Dr. Checcone, I quickly sensed that I was in a very suitable place.  \n\nI now know that Dr. Checcone is very skillful, confident, personable and sensitive to the needs of the patient.  \n\nMost importantly, Dr. Checcone has proper qualifications both in otolaryngology (i.e., ENT) and plastic surgery.

Exams, meds, tubes, more meds, surgery. Except Dr. Dillard’s show adds a head exam, an expensive sleep study and several appointments where he was suppose to come back and tell me what was wrong. Then he concluded I need my seventh nasal surgery. Took him all of two minutes. He could not tell me what he had to fix. It’s all about the money.', 'Dr. Dillard is an excellent Doctor!!! His staff is very kind and friendly. ', ""Very poor time management to look for a patient. If you don't ask him about the progress, you will never get the correct treatment- waste of your time, money and many more.

She is a great listener (no pun intended) and I feel very confident that I'm getting excellent care."", 'My appointment with Dr. Vivas was brief (approximately 10 minutes), but I was billed for an ""extended visit."" I was not impressed with the facilities at Emory either. Public parking garage and secondary lot were full, only more expensive valet was available.
