I was also told that he is now in an administrative role and is only going to be in the office once per month.  Seems like a way to just drop the OLD patients and instead of giving you the real reason they are trying to say after 3 years you are NEW.  This policy covers the entire practice of Doctors so I would not recommend going to this clinic in general.
