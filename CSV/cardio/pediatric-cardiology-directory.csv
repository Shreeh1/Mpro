', 'Dr. Plymale is AMAZING....She has been my sons Cardiologist since we left the NICU and during our first visit she ordered him Medical Oxygen because his little body was having difficulty without it. She was  also present at my sons Hernia surgery appointment and helped us relax and reassured us that our son would be okay. She is simply amassing very kind and has a heart of Gold towards her patients. Our family and especially my son are all blessed to have her as my little ones Cardiologist. ', 'Dr. Mccloskey has been my daughter Cardiologist for 20 years.  He listens and explains things very well.  He does not rush you out of the office.', 'This cardiologist does not like to be asked questions or step you though every inch of the confusion of being diagnosed with heart issues. He takes questions asked as personal attacks leading to offensive responses. He might be a very good cardiologist if you do not need your hand held through each step. He accurately diagnosed my daughter but the communication is all over the phone and lacks compassion and understanding of the families needs in an overwhelming time in life. ', ""We have been to Dr. Park 2 times and loved him and his care both times.  He went above and beyond to explain my teen daughter's heart symptoms in a clear and understandable manner.  Thank you to Dr. Park and his wonderful staff for great care."", 'Dr D’ Souza took its time to explain the exact procedure even using drawings, he answered all our questions and everything went fine the day of the procedure even though the issue couldn’t be fixed because the location of the extra pathway. I recommend Dr. D’Souza 100%']","[""The extremely rude receptionist demanded 600$ from us, AFTER we had a test machine strapped to our son. She said she was unsure about our insurance, and in order to proceed further, she would need that payment. Honestly, she couldn't have been more heartless. Stay away from this office and save yourself the trouble."", 'Dr. Garmany explained the procedures she made on my son along the way.  She asked both he and I questions making both of us at ease. We did not feel rushed but she did not delay her work either, which I appreciated.  I wanted to get my son back to school.  Along the way, she told us what she was seeing in the echo and that all looked great.  Very reassuring.  While we do not need to return, thankfully, if we needed to, she would be our pick. ', ""Dr. Germany is amazing! She was wonderful with my daughter and us when our daughter was born. She explained everything in detail and was very patient. I agree with almost all of the other reviews though her office staff is very rude. They will argue with you about any and everything, her office manager argued with me about my copay. The insurance company had to explain to her why she was wrong and she still couldn't understand. You can't argue with ignorant though."", 'Dr garmany is a great doctor! I also love her nurse Jessica but the receptionist is very rude. She will not let you pick the time that’s best for you. She tried to tell me they don’t have any 10 am slots ever. My daughter is special needs and is hard to get ready in the mornings. She also told me that I didn’t have a far drive. Love the doctor and nurse but needs new office staff.

Thank you Dr.Garmany', 'She was great with my daughter. At 14 she is a very worried little girl. Dr Garmany was awesome with her. ', 'As a healthcare worker myself and an employee of the same health system as Dr. Garmany I can say I am very disappointed with the level of compassion in the office, from the receptionist to the medical assistant to Dr. Garmany herself.
