Over the course of the past 6 yrs, I have experienced significant and painful swelling, redness and tenderness in my entire left leg.  My Primary Care physician as well as several Orthopedic doctors were unable to diagnose the issue and concluded it was probably due to all the surgical trauma the leg had endured over the years.  I was referred to Dr. Sudi who diagnosed I was suffering from May Thurber syndrome and DVT.  Dr. Sudi performed a serial angioplasty of my left femoral vein and common and external iliac veins and deep venous recanalization w stunting of the iliac vein.  Swelling and redness has decreased significantly and energy level has greatly improved.  Dr Sudi is awesome!  This  procedure has improved my quality of life.  I highly recommend Dr. Sudi.', ""At 27 weeks pregnant, I was diagnosed with a large blood clot in my leg. My leg was painful, swollen, and continued to feel heavy and fatigued as my pregnancy continued. I also suffered from pain during intercourse. Once I delivered, I underwent a scheduled venogram where a stent was to be placed. It was not done due to not being able to get through the scar tissue from the clot. I was diagnosed with May Thurner Syndrome and sent to Dr. Sudi. Dr. Sudi was very open and honest with me about my situation and gave me several options. He gave me time to think about the choice I wanted to make without feeling any type of pressure. Dr. Sudi then placed a stent in my iliac vein. Two months post procedure and all of my symptoms have nearly gone away. I feel great and it has also helped to alleviate anxieties of another clot forming knowing I'm a little more protected. Dr. Sudi followed up and checked on me and my progress. I couldn't be happier with my experience."", 'Dr. Sudi (as we patients get to call him) is as warm and charming as he is a brilliant diagnostician and practitioner.

And then, through an internet search, I found Dr. Sudi.  He diagnosed the cause of my pain as May-Thurner Syndrome, a condition little known to most doctors.

Respectively & sincerely, Rebecca Parkinson ', 'Had it not been for Dr. Reichert I would not be alive today. I was taken to another hospital with severe breathing problems. Diagnosed with pneumonia and going downhill after 4 days, the  hospital called Dr. Reichert at Parkwest hospital and advised them of my situation. He accepted me as a patient. I was intubated and taken to Parkwest Hospital. On new years day Dr. Reichert performed a endoscopy and cleaned out my lungs. After that I was on my way to recovery. After 11 days in the hospital, and a lot of breathing treatments and antibiotics I went home. I owe this doctor a sincere debt of gratitude.', ""I would not recommend Dr. Reichert to family. Not professional. He dismissed my medical concerns after 5 minutes of patient interview and did not even take a patient history before passing judgment. He outright argues with patients. I had to defend my diagnosis that was given by 3 doctors and a colleague of Dr. Reichert's. Dr. Reichert laughed in contempt when reading my file and was not knowledgeable about the illness. He even gave PERSONAL remarks regarding my career instead of medical advice"", ""I had pneumonia and was going downhill fast. It was at a time when hospitals weren't accepting patients due to over crowding of flu patients. I was in ICU at LeConte and they weren't able to do the procedure I needed. The hospital contacted Dr. Reichert at Parkwest and he accepted me as a patient. Dr.Reichert did the endoscopy and cleaned out my lungs. Thanks to Dr. Reichert I am alive today very grateful for him accepting me as a patient. Thank you Dr.Reichert!"", ""I seen Dr. Estes about 4 times over 9 months for breathing issues. He said it was C.O.P.D, and prescribed Anoro. The last time I seen him, he was extremely rude, and didnt have time for me, saying I should be getting better. After a second opion, I found out I do not have C.O.P.D., I have asthma.So for 9 months, I couldn't breathe, all because of the Anoro that he prescribed me. I quit taking Anoro, and now feel much better, as Anoro is not for people with asthma. Can cause death for asthmatics"", 'I am very pleased with my treatment from Dr. Estes.

"", 'Horrible rude doctor does not listen to anything you say always has a excuse why I can’t get the treatment I desperately need insurance reasons but not according to my insurance company', ""Dr Kramer comes across as being aloof and uncaring almost to the point of being rude. He may know medicine but he doesn't know how to deal with people. If you want a doctor that's concerned about your well being, this definitely not the doctor for you.
